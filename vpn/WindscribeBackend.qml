// Windscribe backend, driven by the `windscribe-cli` client talking to the
// Windscribe desktop app. Implements the backend contract documented in
// VpnController.qml.
//
// Three things make this one different from the other backends.
//
// The CLI takes a global lock, so no two invocations may overlap — every call
// goes through one queue and one process. See enqueue().
//
// Being installed is not being usable: the CLI is a client for an app you have
// to be logged into, so `detected` waits on the login state and not on the
// binary.
//
// And `connect` is run non-blocking, so it exits 0 the moment the request is
// accepted. The outcome arrives later, in the status line, and until it does a
// failure looks exactly like a success.
